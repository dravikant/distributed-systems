A distributed system is a collection of entities,
each of these entities being
 
autonomous, --- run standalone
programmable, -- code -- essentially processes
asynchronous  -- 

this essentially means that each process or each entity runs according to its own clock 
and these clocks are different entities are processes, are not synchronized with each other. 
They are not always showing the same time as each other 

failure-prone -- may fail or crash at any point in time

and these entities communicate through an unreliable communication medium -- these messages that are being sent may be dropped completely, or they may be delayed for inordinately long periods of time.


The entities are essentially processes.
